# **BLACK CLOVER**
 *In a world where **magic is everything**, Asta and Yuno are both found abandoned at a church on the same day. While Yuno is gifted with exceptional magical powers, **Asta is the only one in this world without any.** At the age of fifteen, both receive grimoires, magic books that amplify their holder's magic.*
